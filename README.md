<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What is this?

Use this extension to de-bias articles on the web and analyze the information presented instead of the spin.

Just find an article you'd like to de-bias on the web.
* Select the URL and press CTRL+C, or right-click and copy in the browser URL bar.
* Open your tab with an ai chatbot running (i.e. x.com/i/grok).
* Click inside the input textbox, then click the extension icon to paste and submit.

Download the Github files from above: Unpack the zip to a location on your PC.

Enable Developer Mode: Navigate to chrome://extensions/ in your Chrome browser and enable Developer mode by checking the box in the top-right corner.

Install the Extension:

### Option A (Unpacked Extension): 
 Go to chrome://extensions/, ensure Developer mode is on, and click "Load unpacked extension...". Select the folder titled Grumpy-Tech-Bronalysis.
 
### Option B (Direct CRX Install, may be limited by current publishing status):
